Determine if Two Events Have Conflict

You are given two arrays of strings that represent two inclusive events that happened on the same day, event1 and event2, where:

event1 = [startTime1, endTime1] and
event2 = [startTime2, endTime2].
Event times are valid 24 hours format in the form of HH:MM.

A conflict happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events).

Return true if there is a conflict between two events. Otherwise, return false.
